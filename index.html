            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Seth and I am a junior this year. 
                I am studying a combination of Computer and Data 
                Science. I am currently employed as a captain for 
                the Dell's Boat Tours, after I graduate, I plan on 
                doing freelance software engineering and attempt to
                create a startup and will continue working at the 
                boats until I can get it off the ground. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                I believe 
                an example of bad web design is lack of 
                consideration for mobile optimization. 
                In the modern world, the web is used for many 
                different types of devices that exist within a 
                spectrum of screen sizes. Failing to consider 
                this factor leads to a website that is not 
                readily accessible to large groups of people. </p>
